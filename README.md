Installation steps
------------------
* copy files (git clone)

* if you don't have precompiled css files, generate stylesheets using lessc:
Compile all *.less files in style/less/
that do have an underscore at the beginning of their name.
Save output as *.css files of same name in the style/ directory

* copy all configuration files from config/default/ to config/ and adjust your settings

* if you want SEO-URLs and have mod_rewrite enabled in your server's configuration,
rename default.htaccess to .htaccess and adjust the root path in the second line.
