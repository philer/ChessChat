Installation steps

* copy files (git clone)
* copy files from config/default/ to config/ and choose your settings
* generate stylesheets using lessc (if you didn't already get them)
* if you want SEO-URLs and have mod_rewrite, rename default.htaccess to .htaccess and adjust the root path in the second line.
